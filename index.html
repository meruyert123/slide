                In the first week, we drew up a plan for what our project would be, and also tried to implement it.
                In the second week we got down to work, where everything was going very badly, because it was extremely difficult to implement what we wanted.
                In the third week, we have already gathered strength and started creating our site called "AYAQ". <br> <br>
                We have created our repository: https://github.com/meruyert123/final <br> <br>
                Next, we created a link to the site itself: https://meruyert123.github.io/final/ <br> <br>
                As a result, we have the last fourth week, where we have already created the main page, 
                supplementing it with several additional pages to make the site look perfect,
                 we decided to distribute it this way, with the main page and the "About us" page worked Diana and Meruyert, and Gabit and Alikhan worked with the rest("Suits","Shoes");
